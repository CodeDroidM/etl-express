# ETL-Express: Full Stack WordPress + React Starter

## Overview

**ETL-Express** is a Dockerized development environment combining:

* A full WordPress stack with MariaDB, Redis, Mailhog, and Nginx
* A React-based UI (ETL dashboard) in the `etl-express-ui/` folder
* Wordfence 2FA and WooCommerce compatibility
* Theme: `saaslauncher`, fully mounted and editable locally

This project is ideal for building data-driven WordPress dashboards with custom UI overlays.

## üîê Admin & Security Notes

* **2FA** is provided by Wordfence. Use a dark-mode CSS override in `style.css` to fix visibility on custom themes.
* Disable access to `/wp-admin/` when embedding React into WordPress, if necessary.

---

## üì¶ WordPress Theme Notes

The `saaslauncher` theme is mounted via Docker volume:

```yaml
- ./wp-content/themes/saaslauncher:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/saaslauncher
```

This allows instant edits to `functions.php`, block templates, and style sheets.

Use this to:

* Customize the WooCommerce My Account page

* Inject menu logic 

---

## üß™ Testing

* WP site: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* React UI: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Mailhog (email catch): [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

## ‚úÖ Troubleshooting

### WordPress showing blank theme or 2FA errors?

Ensure the theme files are complete, especially `functions.php` and `inc/` folder. Fix permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data wp-content/themes/saaslauncher
sudo chmod -R 775 wp-content/themes/saaslauncher
```
